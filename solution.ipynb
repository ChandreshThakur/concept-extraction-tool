    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates a hybrid approach to concept extraction that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combines RAKE with custom dictionaries** for accurate, domain-specific extraction\n",
    "2. **Avoids expensive LLM API calls** while maintaining good performance\n",
    "3. **Provides a framework for future LLM integration** when needed\n",
    "4. **Works across multiple domains** (History, Economics, Mathematics, Physics)\n",
    "5. **Offers both programmatic and interactive interfaces**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is cost-effective, adaptable, and ready for production use in educational and assessment applications."
